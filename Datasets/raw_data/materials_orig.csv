The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â€“ they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ„¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â€“ they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ„¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â€“ they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ„¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

â€‹
Our PYRATEXÂ® upcycled I fabric is made with GOTS certified organic cotton, blended with upcycled cotton, which originates from post industrial and post consumer textile waste. Our fiber producer collects textile residues, used garments and fabric waste from productions all over the world.
â€‹
1kg of virgin cotton needs around 13 000 litres of water during farming, processing and dying.
1kg of our upcycled cotton needs 0 litres: it is not farmed, processed, nor dyed.
The fibers are mechanically recycled, and the yarn is spun in Spain, a process during which 50% of the energy used is solar. It is not a chemical recycling process, and no pulp is involved: the fiber is, and remains, cotton.

This helps mitigate unnecessary textile waste, revive sustainable farming practices and facilitate fair income distribution throughout the textile supply chain.  One acre equals approximately 100 kilos of cotton per season. Crops can be better managed according to season, grown without the use of toxic pesticides or GMOs, and crops can by cycled (i.e. cotton is grown one season and natural dyes the next). The business model ensures long-term development for the farmers. Oshadiâ€™s first brand partner for the project is Christy Dawn.

This helps mitigate unnecessary textile waste, revive sustainable farming practices and facilitate fair income distribution throughout the textile supply chain.  One acre equals approximately 100 kilos of cotton per season. Crops can be better managed according to season, grown without the use of toxic pesticides or GMOs, and crops can by cycled (i.e. cotton is grown one season and natural dyes the next).

Hemp is amongst the most versatile natural fibers, a fast-growing plant requiring very little water and no herbicides, pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or GMO seeds. In comparison, cotton is more water-intensive and takes longer to reach harvest age, producing less fibres per acre.
It is a naturally antibacterial fiber with a great heat capacity ratio compared to all other fibers: it keeps the wearer cool in the summer and warm in the winter.

The seaweed in seacell comes from the Northern Atlantic, with anti oxidant properties, certified by European laboratories, thanks to its high content in vitamin E and minerals such as sodium, magnesium or calcium. 
It also inhibits the formation of free reactive oxygen species which are formed in living organisms when in contact with oxygen and act by altering cell membranes and attacking the genetic material of cells.
