The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

The tropical plant leaves are not monoculture, commercial crops â they are renewable resources that grow freely on the banks of forests and rivers. They are collected in sustainable areas near the Nova Kaeru facilities and planted together with reforestation farms. The close proximity of beLeafâ¢ production decreases the carbon footprint, and emissions are offset by the positive impact of reforestation, which provides oxygen to the atmosphere. In addition, organic waste from the tanning processes are composted and reused as soil nutrients to help protect biodiversity and waterways, and water from tanning is reused for irrigation of the plants. Nova Kaeru has developed its own organic, chrome-free tanning technology based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins. This more sustainable tanning approach leads to superior, quality materials free of heavy metals that are environmentally safe.

1kg of virgin cotton needs around 13 000 litres of water during farming, processing and dying.
1kg of our upcycled cotton needs 0 litres: it is not farmed, processed, nor dyed.
The fibers are mechanically recycled, and the yarn is spun in Spain, a process during which 50% of the energy used is solar. It is not a chemical recycling process, and no pulp is involved: the fiber is, and remains, cotton.

Hemp is amongst the most versatile natural fibers, a fast-growing plant requiring very little water and no herbicides, pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or GMO seeds. In comparison, cotton is more water-intensive and takes longer to reach harvest age, producing less fibres per acre.

They only cut mature leaves of the plant without damaging the plant itself, ensuring that every 6-8 months they can havest new material from the same plant. Cactus is a strong plant, which can handle low temperatures during winter and its thorns are small, making it safe to harvest. After cutting the mature leaves, they are dried under the sun for three days. No additional energy or heat is necessary for this process.

natural processes rather than artificial inputs.
Organic cotton farming does not allow the use of toxic chemicals or GMOs (genetically modified organisms), instead combining tradition, innovation and science to benefit the environment and promote a good quality of life for all
   involved.
Compared to growing regular cotton, organic cotton reduces field emissions
from fertilizer, energy use, and needs less irrigation.
The organic cotton in this fabric is blended with ROICA elastane, a 100% degradable replacement for traditional elastane. It is eco friendly because it has:

 Seacell is a fibre originating from the Northern Atlantic, with anti oxidant properties, certified by European laboratories, thanks to its high content in Vitamin E and minerals such as sodium, magnesium or calcium. It also inhibits the formation of free reactive oxygen species, which are formed in living organisms when in contact with oxygen and act by altering cell membranes and attacking the
 genetic material of cells.

The seacell fiber is blended with Standard 100 Oeko-Tex certified tencelÂ® fibers, produced in Austria,
Great Britain and the U.S: they are renewable, wood-based fibers, based on various tree species, including eucalyptus, spruce, pine, birch and beech. All these tree species are grown in natural forests and sustainably managed plantations, without using chemical fertilisers.

â
The seaweed in seacell comes from the Northern Atlantic, with anti oxidant properties, certified by European laboratories, thanks to its high content in vitamin E and minerals such as sodium, magnesium or calcium. 
It also inhibits the formation of free reactive oxygen species which are formed in living organisms when in contact with oxygen and act by altering cell membranes and attacking the genetic material of cells. 
â
The seacell fiber is blended with GOTS certified organic cotton. Its production sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people by using natural processes rather than artificial inputs. Organic cotton farming does not allow the use of toxic chemicals or GMOs, instead combining tradition, innovation and science to benefit the environment and promote a good quality of life for all involved. 
â
Compared to growing regular cotton, organic cotton reduces emissions from fertiliser, energy use and needs less irrigation.

Properties: 
ANTI IRRITATION: Fiber is proven to be compatible with human skin cells (keratinocytes)

ELIMINATES FREE RADICALS: Captures reactive oxygen species, preventing them from interacting with the skin and damaging it

SKINCARE: Seacell contains amino acids, vitamins and minerals beneficial for skin
